# TikTok Verification Bot

A Discord bot that verifies users' TikTok accounts by checking for a unique code in their TikTok bio. Perfect for communities that want to link Discord members to their TikTok profiles.

## Features

- 🔐 **One-click verification** - Users click "Verify TikTok" to start
- 🎯 **Unique codes** - Bot generates server-specific codes (e.g., `JAIME-12345`)
- ✅ **Automatic role assignment** - Verified users get a role automatically
- 📋 **Verified users list** - Admins can view and export all verified users
- 💾 **Persistent storage** - Verified users are saved to JSON file
- 🌐 **24/7 hosting ready** - Designed for Railway, Heroku, or any Node.js host
- 🏥 **Health checks** - Automatic checks every 4 hours to ensure TikTok access
- 🔧 **TikTok bypass** - Uses TikTok app user agents to avoid blocking

## How Verification Works

1. User clicks **"Verify TikTok"** button
2. Bot shows a unique verification code
3. User adds the code to the **beginning** of their TikTok bio
4. User clicks **"I Added the Code"** and enters their TikTok profile link
5. Bot checks their bio for the code
6. If found, user receives the **Verified** role and is saved to the database

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Discord Developer Portal Setup

1. Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Click **"New Application"** and give it a name
3. Go to the **Bot** section and click **"Add Bot"**
4. Copy your **Bot Token** (you'll need this for `.env`)

#### Enable Privileged Intents

In the **Bot** section, scroll down to **Privileged Gateway Intents** and enable:
- ✅ **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT**
- ✅ **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**

Click **Save Changes**.

#### Get Your Application Info

From the **General Information** tab, copy:
- **Application ID**
- **Public Key**

---

### 2. Invite the Bot to Your Server

Use this URL (replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your Application ID):

```
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&permissions=268698648&scope=bot%20applications.commands
```

Or use the OAuth2 URL Generator:
1. Go to **OAuth2** → **URL Generator**
2. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `bot`
   - ✅ `applications.commands`
3. Select bot permissions:
   - ✅ Manage Roles
   - ✅ Send Messages
   - ✅ Read Message History
   - ✅ Use Slash Commands
4. Copy the generated URL and open it in your browser
5. Select your server and authorize the bot

### 3. Create the Verified Role

1. In your Discord server, go to **Server Settings** → **Roles**
2. Create a new role called **"Verified Viewer"** (or any name you prefer)
3. Right-click the role and select **"Copy Role ID"**
   - (You need Developer Mode enabled: User Settings → App Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode)
4. Save this Role ID for the `.env` file

**Important:** Make sure the bot's role is **higher** than the "Verified Viewer" role in the role hierarchy, otherwise it won't be able to assign the role.

---

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the `jaime-tiktok-bot` folder:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
DISCORD_APPLICATION_ID=your_application_id_here
DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
BOT_PREFIX=!
VERIFIED_ROLE_ID=your_verified_role_id_here
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials.

### 5. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd jaime-tiktok-bot
npm install
```

---

### 6. Run the Bot

```bash
node index.js
```

You should see: `Logged in as YourBotName#1234`

## Troubleshooting

### "Used disallowed intents" Error
- Make sure you enabled **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT** and **MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT** in the Discord Developer Portal

### Bot can't assign roles
- Ensure the bot's role is **higher** than the Verified Viewer role in Server Settings → Roles

### "I could not read your TikTok profile"
- The user's TikTok profile must be **public**
- Run `!test-tiktok` to check if the bot can access TikTok
- Check Railway logs for health check results

### TikTok blocking requests
- The bot uses TikTok app user agents to bypass blocking
- Health checks run every 4 hours and log results
- Use `!test-tiktok` to manually verify TikTok access

### Bot not responding to commands
- Make sure the bot has permission to read messages in the channel
- Check that you're using the correct prefix (default: `!`)

- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude `.env`
- If your bot token is ever exposed, regenerate it immediately in the Discord Developer Portal
